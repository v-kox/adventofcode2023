# Advent of Code 2023

These are my Python solution for the 2023 advent of code puzzles: https://adventofcode.com/2023


All solution are implemented using the Python standard library.
With the notable exceptions of day 24 where a there is a dependency on `sympy` (because I didn't feel like implementing a linear equation solver)
and unit tests for which I used pytest.

Many thanks to [topaz](https://github.com/topaz) for creating the puzzles and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) for not making me go insane.
